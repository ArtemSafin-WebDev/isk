                        The Middle Years Programme (MYP) is a curriculum framework designed by the International
                        Baccalaureate (IB) for learners aged 11-16. The programme aims for students to make connections
                        between what they are learning through their studies and the real world. MYP is an inclusive
                        program that benefits students who come with a range of interests and abilities.
